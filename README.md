## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Used the <picture> tag for the first time

### Continued development

- I found it hard to size the card and the component, felt like I used properties susch as max/min-width and somehow made it workout without fully understanding.
- need to improve my media querires.
- Need to learn how to analyze a layout and translate it into html better.
